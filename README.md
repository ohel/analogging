# Analogging

An IoT project to read the analog in value on an ESP8266 board and post the data to a cloud service (e.g. Azure) for further processing. The ESP8266 is then set to deep sleep and the process is repeated.

This can be used for example to monitor the soil moisture level of a house plant so that it doesn't get too dry. Code for a project like this using Azure functions is in the soilmoisture-azure directory.
